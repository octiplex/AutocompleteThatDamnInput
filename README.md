# Autocomplete That Damn Input

## Presentation

Some web developers think that disabling password autocompletion will increase the security of their users. Because, hey, everybody knows than writing your password in a text file or on a sticky note is much safer than letting Safari storing it in your encrypted keychain!

Maybe some people manage to remember douzens of randomly-chosen 12-character passwords. But the rest of use won't memorize more than a few passwords and think that disabling autocompletion is a considerable hassle. The `autocomplete` attribute is an horror which should have never been allowed to exist. Hopefully Safari extensions allow you to inject JavaScript into webpages so you can remove that attribute.

*Delete That Damn Event* is a Safari extension that forces autocompletion for all HTML inputs.
